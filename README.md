Name of Framework: # Shakeem_IntroGameProg_Spring2020

Link of Framework: https://github.com/shakeem-brown/Shakeem_IntroGameProg_Spring2020.git

Overview of Framework:
This Framework allows users to choose what board game to play, such as TikTacToe and Battleship, from the main menu.

Framework Structure & Features:
- Libraries:
The Framework has three specific libraries - logic, display, and input - that all do their specified tasks. The logic library has functions pertaining to the flow of the game as it is being played (bools / if-else statements). There are four functions in the logic library. The Display library has a function that outputs an image to the console so players can see the changes made as the game runs. There is one function in the display library. The Input library would take inputs from the players and would use these inputs and store them in functions. These functions would be used throughout the game. Lastly, there are no functions in the input library.
- Main:
The Menu allows the player to choose the game they want to play from a selection of three games as well as quitting the game too. In our demonstration, we will only be showing off the TicTacToe game since this game is the most polished one in our list of games. 
- TicTacToe:
As the name implies, this game functions like the on-paper version of TicTacToe. Unlike the real game, however, you do not have to worry about running out of paper. You are allowed to play as much as your heart desires.

Future Plans:
This Framework will be used as our final project of Intro to Game Programming. After which it will most likely never see the light of day again. Despite this, the use of a menu system will be implemented in our future projects.
